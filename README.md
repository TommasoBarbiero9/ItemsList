        In this repository you will find the foundation of what could be your next iOS App
        with HTTP CRUD functions and a basic SwiftUI view fully ready to use and work through.
        The app is missing all the database creation part, you indeed have to create your own,
        I suggest you to do it using Vapor, a very powerful framework (documentation below).
        You also need, after creating you Vapor App (you can find an already made one below),
        to setup your docker container and port forward via ngrok and paste the url you're
        gonna get from it at line 12 in the ItemsList/Utilities/Constans.swift file to finally
        make your db public and visible inside your iOS App.
